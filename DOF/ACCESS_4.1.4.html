There are three ways for the democrat to gain the upper hand in East Germany:<br>
a, Gaining an early foothold in either the Magdeburg-Halle-KarlMarxStadt or Berlin-Schwerin-Rostock worker triangles.<br>
b, Middle Year pressure through a combination of Ops and events.<br>
c, Monday Demonstrations (after <a href=024.html>St. Nicholas Church</a> has been triggered)
The communist player must wherever possible avoid a, and c, through access denial and not triggering <a href=024.html>St. Nicholas Church</a>. Respectively. He will then in all likelihood at some point in the game have to survive b,.
Early Year, aside from Initial influence placement and Support Checks on Berlin, the democrat player will mainly gain access to the East Germany worker triangles through three routes.<br>
<br>
<b>a, Wroclaw -> Dresden (Magdeburg-Halle-KarlMarxStadt worker triangle)</b><br>
As soon as the fiercest fighting over Poland and Hungary dies down the Communist player should use two “spare” Ops to take control of Dresden before the Democrat places any SPs there. If the Communist doesn’t then the Democrat player will be able to “cheaply” move into Dresden and force the Communist player on the defensive. The Communist player will have to react by taking control of Dresden if he doesn’t want the Democrat player to move into Karl-Marx-Stadt without the threat of a +1 Support Check by the Communist player. Controlling Dresden early can also help with a Democrat player’s move into Leipzig described below.<br>

<br>
<b>b, Lutheran Church -> Leipzig (Magdeburg-Halle-KarlMarxStadt or Berlin-Schwerin-Rostock worker triangle)</b>
If the Communist player hasn’t taken control of Dresden and Berlin he can easily be caught off guard by a Democrat move into Leipzig. This will often happen after the <a href=024.html>St. Nicholas Church</a> event which gives the Democrat player’s move into Leipzig some cover.

<img src=ACCESS_DDR_LEIPZIG.jpg><br>
The Communist player is then forced to scramble. One the one hand he needs to protect Berlin from Support Checks to not get locked out of the Berlin-Schwerin-Rostock worker triangle and at the same time take control of Berlin to threaten Leipzig and to deny the Democrat player “cheap” access to the East German Intellectual/Student spaces (if he doesn’t already have it). On the other hand the Communist player needs to immediately take Control of Dresden and move into Karl-Marx-Stadt have the edge in the Magdeburg-Halle-KarlMarxStadt worker triangle. The Communist cannot do both in a single Round and should therefore whenever possible build up East Germany before the Democrat makes his move.<br>

Below the correct Communist player reaction to St Nicholas Church.<br>

<img src=ACCESS_DDR_LEIPZIG_STRONG_A.jpg><br>
When the Communist player draws St Nicholas Church Turn 1 or Turn 2 before East Germany heats up (and he is able to hold it) he can take control of Leipzig after taking control of Dresden, thereby avoiding a war on two fronts while impeding the Democrat player’s access to both the Berlin-Schwerin-Rostock worker triangle and the East German Intellectual/Student spaces and protecting Berlin from Support Checks.<br>
<img src=ACCESS_DDR_LEIPZIG_STRONG_B.jpg><br>
To understand the likelihood of the Democrat gaining presence though a Support Check.
The odds for Democrat presence after +0 Support Check(s) on Berlin:<br>
- 4 Ops card (if both SC rolls are used on Berlin if possible) = 53%<br>
- The <a href=014.html>Gorbachev Charms the West</a> event (1SP left after removal) = 50%<br>
- 3 Ops card (if both SC rolls are used on Berlin if possible) = 31%<br>
<br>
<b>c, German Writers -> Walter Ulbricht Academy -> Berlin (Berlin-Schwerin-Rostock worker triangle)</b><br>
This more predictable and slower move by the Democrat player is easier for the Communist player to anticipate and react to.
