When we take a look at the Support Check roll tables we notice that using the Ops
for a Support Check only pays from certain Modifiers for the different Stability spaces.

Below I will try to summarize some things you need to take into account when considering a Support Check.
</p>
<p>
Stability 5:
</p>
<p>
<a href=Stab5.html>Stability 5 SC Roll Tables</a>
</p>
<p>
For a Stability 5 space a support check only becomes interesting at a +5 modifier. This means the Catholic Church space in Poland only even with an additional modifiers on top of controlling all neighboring spaces.  This is a very unlikely support check for multiple reasons. First of all it will almost certainly be only the democrat doing the support check as the democrat usually will control the South-West of Poland. Secondly the Communist would need to play in the Polish Catholic Church space. This would most likely be through the Legacy of Martial Law event and not through SP placement and only if there is no better target Than the neighboring worker spaces. Also  why waste a valuable high Ops (overkill) when Papal Visit is still in the deck or a card low Ops card can fix the damage? Finally by the time the Democrat controls enough of these neighboring worker spaces the fate of Poland will likely already be decided and be democrat controlled.

<p>
Stability 4:
</p>
<p>
<a href=Stab4.html>Stability SC 4 Roll Tables</a>
</p>
<p>
For a Stability 5 space a support check only becomes interesting at a +3 modifier.
This means only Elite spaces : Dresden (EG), Szombathely (HU), Pizefi (CZ), Stara-Zagora (BU) and Cluj-Napoca (RO) and Farmer spaces: Bialystok (PL), Lublin (PL), Szeged (HU), Craiova (RO) without considering additional modifiers on top of controlling all neighboring spaces are targets.

Still Support Checks on these spaces are relatively uncommon.

For the Elite spaces Dresden and Cluj-Napoca seems the most interesting as a surround of 4 spaces is possible. In practice the  initial influence and Communist Romania Events will result in the Communist controlling many if not all neighboring spaces and these Elite spaces themselves. If  after Monday Demonstrations and/or Normalization the Democrat finds himself surrounding Dresden a Support Check can be considered. A more likely surround in favor of the Democrat would be Szombathely. But only after Nagy Reburied and Nomenklatura are out and after considering if it is worth sacrificing a 4 Ops card.
For the Farmer spaces controlling all neighboring countries would cost you at least 9-10 SPs. This is pricey for to get an small return on the Support Check using a high Ops card. Therefore it will only become interesting if the Support Check can deny access to a region or presence in a country and mostly for the Communist player.
Because the communist almost always plays into Warszawa and aided by a successful support check of Gdansk  and the Peasant Parties Event can lead to a surround of a democratically controlled Lublin (PL). This can be a target to deny the Democrat access and sure up the North-East of Poland if Poland is hotly contested. The denial of democratic presence is more likely through a Support Check on Craiova (RO).

Stability 3:
</p>
<p>
<a href=Stab3.html>Stability SC 3 Roll Tables</a>
</p>
<p>
This is where Support Checks start getting interesting. Without the paralyzing effect of Helsinki Final Act. A +1 modifier can  be enough to roll average SP above the Ops value of the card with your two Support Checks. A 4 Ops card will result in an average 5 SP difference. When you get the chance you should of course try to get the +2 modifier where a 3 Ops card will result in an average 5 SP difference and a 4 Ops card will result in a 7 SP difference. Your opponent should be trying to prevent this though. There are many stability 3 spaces that can be the target of support checks throughout the game. I will only discuss the most common.

Poland:
Gdansk (neighboring spaces = 5): If the communist decides to contest Poland the game will often open with a Support Check on Gdansk. Gdansk can no longer be Support Checked by the Communist after Solidarity Legalized is played.
Warszawa (neighboring spaces = 5): If (after the play of Solidarity and Walesa) the democrat has gotten the upper hand in North-East Poland (and the communist has let it slip ) and Poland scoring is still in play the Democrat can use advantage this to deny presence or gain control.
Poznan & Lodz (neighboring spaces = 4): These are frontline countries when the Democrat (South-West) and Communist (North-East) have divided the country amongst themselves. An even number of neighboring spaces will often result in a +0 modifier because each played will control the same amount of neighboring spaces. This is where card that first allow you to place/remove SP before doing a Support Check (e.g. Gorbachov Charms the West, Walesa, …) or two back-to back action rounds come in handy.

Hungary:
Budapest (neighboring space  = 4):
Tatabanya (neighboring spaces = 3):

East Germany:
Leipzig (neighboring spaces = 5):
Berlin (neighboring spaces = 4):
Karl Marx-Stadt (neighboring spaces = 4):
Halle & Magdeburg (neighboring spaces = 3):

Czechoslovakia:

Bulgaria:
Ruse (neighboring spaces = 4):


Romania:
