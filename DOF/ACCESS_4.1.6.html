Completely denying access to Poland to the Democrat player is impossible due to his control of the Polish Catholic Church space and powerful events like <a href=002.html>Solidarity Legalized</a> and <a href=003.html>Walesa</a>. The best a Communist player can do is securing the Gdansk-Szczecin-Poznan worker triangle that would otherwise normally gravitate towards the Democrat player, keep the Polish farmer spaces Lublin and Bialystok and if possible through superior Ops take the often contested Polish battlegrounds that can go either way (e.g. Lodz and to a lesser extent Wroclaw). All of this is very expensive and even when achieved by the Communist player in Early Year it will can still come undone through Middle Year and Late Year pressure through pressure caused by Democrat events and Ops or it can not pay off in VPs through for example only a single Turn 3 draw or a Democrat player discard <a href=006.html>Brought in for Questioning</a>/<a href=075.html>Exit Visas</a>/Foreign News Coverage or avoiding to play through a Turn 10 triggering of the <a href=077.html>Samizdat</a> event. Even if none of this happens the Powers Struggle won’t be a walk in the park as the Democrat player should always be able to hang on to at least 5 spaces with a little help of <a href=017.html>Roundtable Talks</a> and, luck of the draw and good rolls for initiative it could still go his way.
To have a decent chance of  taking over the Gdansk-Szczecin-Poznan worker triangle will require both 4-6 initial influence SPs and a Turn 1 – Action Round 1 Support Check of 3-4 Ops (or <a href=014.html>Gorbachev Charms the West</a>) or 4-6 initial influence SPs and the play of either <a href=007.html>State Run Media</a> or Worker Party Cells. This while preferably holding <a href=002.html>Solidarity Legalized</a> as Turn 1 – Action Round 1 it practically gives access to the whole of Poland and protects Gdansk from further Support Checks by the Communist player. The Communist player must start by placing 1 in Szczecin and one in Poznan and then for a +2 modifier Support Check either take control of either Szczecin and Warsawa (shown below) or Szczecin and Poznan or for a +1 modifier Support Check only take Control of the Szczecin space.
