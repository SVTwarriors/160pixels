<a href=002.html>Solidarity Legalized</a>:<br>
If the Communist player draws the <a href=002.html>Solidarity Legalized</a> card in Turn 1 he gains an advantage in Poland. Early Year the Communist player will then to a large extent control  if and/or when the <a href=002.html>Solidarity Legalized</a> event will be triggered and not need to worry about the follow up <a href=003.html>Walesa</a> event. If his hand is strong aside from the <a href=002.html>Solidarity Legalized</a> card he can  try to retain Power in Poland. Even with this advantage this won't be easy though because of the onslaught of Neutral "where you opponent holds Power" events and Democrat "Eastern Europe" events. but if the Communist player is able to hold Power in Poland 2 times (or even 3x) it is well worth the effort. If the Communist player’s hand is weak and/or he won't be able to hold the <a href=002.html>Solidarity Legalized</a>card into next Turn he can more easily give up Power in Poland on his terms. Even when the Communist player loses or surrenders Power in Poland he should still resist Democrat control cost-efficiently and keep presence for Final Scoring.<br>
<br>
<a href=024.html>St. Nicholas Church</a>/<a href=026.html>Helsinki Final Act</a>:<br>
Early Year the <a href=024.html>St. Nicholas Church</a> card and the <a href=026.html>Helsinki Final Act</a> card are two Democrat cards the Communist player would like to hold into Next Turn no matter what. The Communist player doesn’t want to risk having triggered from the Discard pile with the <a href=036.html>Dash for the West</a> event or have them drawn by the Democrat player after the Turn 3 reshuffle. Even if it is better for the Communist player to have these cards in his Opening hand (as opposed to have the Democrat player draw them) it can force the Communist player to trigger other Democrat events.<br>
<br>
<a href=022.html>Poland scoring</a>:<br>
When drawing the <a href=022.html>Poland scoring</a> card in his opening hand, depending on the strength of that hand the Communist player can attempt to hold Power in Poland by investing most of his Early Year Ops there or go for damage control by opening with a tactical retreat. If the Communist player hasn’t drawn <a href=002.html>Solidarity Legalized</a> there is a 25% chance the Democrat player will be holding it in his opening hand, drastically tipping the scales in favor of a damage control strategy. If the Communist player in Turn 1 draws <a href=022.html>Poland scoring</a>, in a weak hand without <a href=002.html>Solidarity Legalized</a>, he should score Poland cheaply by taking the Polish Writers space with his two last initial influence Support Points. This should give the Communist player a shot at winning the Power Struggle. Depending on the outcome of the Power Struggle the Communist player can still decide to surrender Power in Poland or not. The rest of the Ops of the weak hand can then be used to try to hold on to Hungary and lock the Democrat player out of the Middle Year countries. This is explained in more detail <a href=INITIAL_OPENING.html>here</a>.<br>
<br>
<a href=023.html>Hungary scoring</a>:<br>
The Communist player, based on the other cards he drew (or didn’t draw) alongside <a href=023.html>Hungary scoring</a> for his opening hand (e.g. <a href=040.html>Hungarian Democratic Forum</a>, <a href=037.html>Nagy Reburied</a>, <a href=014.html>Gorbachev Charms the West</a>, <a href=018.html>Pozsgay Defends the Revolution</a>, …) needs to decide between an aggressive approach, a defensive approach and a tactical retreat with a possible early surrender of Power in Hungary. An aggressive approach involves using all 7 initial influence SPs to control the Miskolc space, the Tatabanya space and the Eotvos Lorand University space and then Support Checking Budapest in Action Round 1. A tactical retreat on the other hand involves taking control of the Hungarian Intellectual space with the last 2 initial influence SPs and a quick and dirty Action Round 1 scoring of Hungary. This is explained in more detail <a href=INITIAL_OPENING.html>here</a>.<br>
<br>
<a href=025.html>Perestroika</a>:<br>
A weak hand without (m)any cards the Communist player want to play for the event and Democrat cards with events referring to “The Ops value of this card” (e.g. <a href=040.html>Hungarian Democratic Forum</a>, <a href=027.html>Consumerism</a>, <a href=003.html>Walesa</a>, …) can be significantly improved by an Action Round 1 play of the <a href=025.html>Perestroika</a> event. This means the Communist player cannot do an Action Round 1 Support Check and the Democrat player might choose to instead. Therefore the Communist player should place his initial influence Support Points defensively.<br>
<br>
<a href=013.html>Stasi</a>:<br>
A weak opening hand will sometimes mean the Communist players starting position after the initial influence placement phase quickly deteriorates during Turn 1. If the Communist player draws no Power Struggle cards he can not choose to cut his losses by playing a Scoring cards early and surrendering Power. If however he drew <a href=013.html>Stasi</a> he can play this Action Round 1 to try to persuade the Democrat player to play any Scoring card he holding on Action Round 1. If the Democrat player doesn’t play along he opens himself up to a damaging play of <a href=007.html>State Run Media</a>, <a href=014.html>Gorbachev Charms the West</a> and to a lesser extent <a href=028.html>Factory Party Cells</a> and <a href=037.html>Nagy Reburied</a>). If the Communist player didn't draw any Scoring cards there is a 43,35% chance the Democrat player drew at least 1 Scoring card and he shouldn’t discount the possibility his Opponent is holding 2 Scoring cards.<br>
<br>
Access denial Openings with the <a href=007.html>State Run Media</a> event or the <a href=014.html> Gorbachev Charms the West</a> events are explained in more detail <a href=ACCESS_4.1.html>here</a>.
