As already explained most Power Struggle involve an element of bluff, but besides this there is also an element of card counting and the interpretation of the opponents decisions. Below I will try to list the tactics used during the Power Struggle.<br>
<br>
Before the Power Struggle even starts in earnest each player, starting with the player who played the Scoring card, is allowed to Raise the Stakes by discarding three of his Power Struggle cards. A lot of information can be gathered in this step. It can indicate a player is confident he will win the Power Struggle, thinks he will win on a Petition or he is desperate to take Control of the country for the sake of events on the Strategy cards he is holding or (in the case of the Democrat player) for Final scoring purposes. The type of cards the player chooses to discard can also indicate which suit his hand is overweight in and which Leaders he knows his opponent isn’t holding. Knowing the opponent has discarded his unplayable Leader cards and/or surplus suits and/or useless Wild cards makes Support Falters more effective.<br>
<br>
Below are the tactics to gain an advantage or to deceive the opponent once the Power Struggle has started in earnest:<br>
<br>
Tactic:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Attack with the lower value cards of the March/Strike suit.<br>
Effects: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Test the strength of your opponent in this suit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Keep the high value cards for the final push.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Risk losing initiative.<br>
<br>

<br>
Tactic: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Open with and/or keep attacking with Petition.<br>
Effects: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Win with the Petition suit by the opponent being unable to or choosing not to match.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Lure the opponent to wasting the Tactic Fails card or his playable leaders.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Deceive opponent into thinking the rest of your hand is weak and lure him into wasting the Tactic Fails card or his playable leaders.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Likely keep the initiative.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Effect country scoring. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Lose initiative.<br>
<br>

Effects: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Deceive the opponent into thinking you have run out of this suit and lure him into wasting one of his playable leaders in an attack with this suit or instead have him use his Tactic Fails cards and/or playable Leader cards on an other suit. <br>
