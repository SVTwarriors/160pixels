This is an unofficial strategy guide for the boardgame “1989: Dawn of Freedom” which was released by GMT in 2012. In the next eight chapters I will explain the different aspects of this superb boardgame. This should help both novice and intermediate players improve their game and appreciate the different mechanics that make up the game and make it so interesting.
In chapter 1 I will run through all <a href=cards.html>110 strategy cards</a>, crudely score their event from 1 to 6 for both players and explain the Democrat play and Communist play. Understanding how to weigh your options, to mitigate, combine and time your and your opponent's events is the core of the boardgame. Even novice players will need to know their Early Year cards and what to consider when deciding how to play them. 
Later chapters will cover the <a href=PS_2.1.html>Power Struggle</a>, <a href=OPENING_3.1.html>Opening stategy</a>, <a href=ACCESS_4.1.html>Access Denial</a>, the <a href=TST_5.1.html>Tiananmen Square Track</a> (or TST), <a href=SC.html>Support Checks</a>, Final Scoring and the worker triangles. 
Things I won’t be doing, though tempting, is drawing the comparison between “1989: Dawn of Freedom” and the popular GMT game “Twilight Struggle”. Players that are familiar with “Twilight Struggle” will be able to recognize some similarities in SP placement, strategy cards, turn sequence and event triggering. This should help them on the uptake. There are however many subtle and less subtle differences that I would find hard to explain without boring you and myself, nor do I think I would enlighten readers that haven’t played “Twilight Struggle” (yet). 
I also won’t be annoying readers with a anything except the more nuanced application of the rules that are explained clearly in the rulebook. So please read the rulebook before you read his strategy guide.
