<u>Guide to intial influence placement</u>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font size=4>
<u>Introduction:</u>
</font>
<br>
The initial influence placement at the start of the game will to a great extent be determined by the Communists hand, his intial influence placement and the Democrat's reaction.
Depending on the card the Communist player draws  Turn 1 he will either focus on Poland, Hungary divide his attention over both Early Year countries.
The goal of the first couple of starting influence is to claim spaces (The opponent is not allowed to place starting influence in a space that already contains your influence).
If possible with the remaining starting influnce you then try to set yourself up for a Support Check with a +1 or +2 modifier (Communist) or defend yoursef against it (Democrat).
Otherwise if during the starting influence placement it becomes clear a good SC will not be possible the Communist can decide to take control of spaces with Ops in AR1 trying to form defensive traigles.
I will try to explain the main aspects effecting intitial influence placement below.
As you will read below alot depends on if the communist draws Solidarity Legalized in Turn 1.
Solidarity legalized massively effects the fate of Poland and thus Early Year.

<u>Solidarity Legalized:</u>
</font>
<br>
If the communist draws Solidarity Legalized in Turn 1 and is able to hold it he has a chance in Poland.
But remember that communist power in Poland isn't guaranteed.
The communist will need the spend alot of Ops to take control of the spaces in the North-East of Poland.
After having invested all these Ops the democrat could still manage to discard Poland Scoring. 
Even if there is a Power Striggle in Poland it will probably be very close and could easily tip in the democrats favour through Round Table Talks and/or luck.
So the communist should consider his hand carefully before focussing all his efforts on Poland.
If however the communist manages to retain power in Poland 2x or 3x the effort is well worth the prize.
Otherwise his strategy should likely be damage control in Poland.
The damage control involves having (at least) presence during Poland Scoring and surrendering Power.
After surrendering Power in Poland the communist can then use the 4 Ops of Solidarity Legalized in still contested countries.

<u>St Nicholas Church:</u>
</font>
<br>
St. Nicholas church is the main reason the communist would be unable to hold Solidarity Legalized if drawn on AR1.
The communist will have a hard time finding the Ops to retain power in both East Germany and Poland nevermind the flexibility to avoid triggering events.
</p>
<p>
<font size=4>
<u>Poland scoring:</u>
</font>
<br>
The communist can either decide to score Poland early Turn 1 or late Turn 1.
Scoring Poland early Turn 1 means the communist is not willing to go for Poland 100%.
For example if he did not draw or is unable to hold Solidarity Legalized Turn 1.
Poland can be scored cheaply by taking control of the Intellectuals space with your two last initial SPs.
Depending on the outcome of the PS you can decide to surrender control of Poland or not.
The communists other intial SPs are best used in Hungary.
There is a good chance the communist won't retain Power in Poland and the communist shouldn't already be
giving up on both Early Year countries in Turn 1.
Scoring Poland late Turn 1 is best only done when holding Solidarity Legalized otherwise you might end up regretting it.
</p>
<p>
<font size=4>
<u>Hungary scoring:</u>
</font>
<br>
If the communist is going to go for Poland because he drew Solidarity Legalized Turn 1 and is able to hold it
then drawing Hungary scoring can allow him to place all his initial SP in Poland and only worry about Hungary later in the Turn.
If however the communist hand is so bad he fears he will be overwhelmed in Hungary he could score Hungary early Turn 1.

<u>Gorbachev Charms the West:</u>
</font>
Gorbachev Charms the West:
Gobachev Charms the West is a very flexible event.
The removal of 2 Ops can be used both offensively to get a better modifier on the SC and/or to break control of enemy spaces for scoring purposes and/or to deny access.
Considering his use Gorbachev Charms the West AR1 can alter the communist's initial influence placement.  
</p>

<font size=4>
<u>High Ops cards:</u>
</font>
<br>
High ops cards can be used for SCs or outspending your opponent in SP placement in Turn 1.
Considering his Turn 1 hand strength can alter the communist's initial influence placement.
