The Communist player’s opening strategy will to a great extent be determined by the Communist player's hand, his initial influence placement and the Democrat player's reaction to it. Depending on the cards the Communist player draws Turn 1 he will either focus on Poland, Hungary or divide his attention and effort over both Early Year countries. The goal of each player when playing their first initial influence Support Points is to claim spaces (Neither player is allowed to place the starting influence Support Points in a space that already contains the opponent's Support Points). Afterwards with the remaining initial influence Support Points each player takes Control of spaces neighboring target spaces for either offensive or defensive Support Checks. Based on his hand the Democrat player's placement of his 7 initial influence Support Points the Communist player can still adjust his opening strategy with the placement of his last 2 initial influence Support Points. Instead of doing a Turn 1, Action Round 1, Support Check he can make a tactical retreat from either Hungary or Poland or deny the Democrat access to Hungary or Czechoslovakia with a Support Points removal event (e.g. <a href=007.html>State Run Media</a>, …) or decide to beef up a position in an Early Year country with a Support Point placement event (e.g. <a href=032.html> Peasant Parties, <a href=037.html>Nagy Reburied</a>). In <a href=OPENING_3.2.html>3.2, Opening Hand Strength</a> and <a href=OPENING_3.3.html>3.3, Standard Openings</a> the most important considerations for initial influence placement for the Communist player are summed up. During this phase of the game the Democrat player should try to interpret the Communist player's initial influence placement, consider the Communist player's possible options and react accordingly. Access denial openings against Hungary and Czechoslovakia are explained in more depth in <a href=ACCESS_4.1.html>Part 4</a>.
