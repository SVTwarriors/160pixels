In most games the Democrat player will control the Bulgarian Minority space and the Intellectual/Student spaces. These alone often aren’t enough to win Power Struggles. Aside from Support Checks and Mid Year/Late Year events there are two routes for the democrat to gain the upper in Bulgaria: <br>
<br>
<b>a, Taking control of the Ruse-Varna-Burgas worker triangle:</b><br>
In Bulgaria during Early Year both players will try to gain control of the Ruse-Varna-Burgas worker triangle. The communist player will need to move before the democrat player takes control of Ruse through the <a href=039.html>Eco-Glasnost</a> event or by placing SPs after gaining access to Razgrad with the <a href=033.html>Sajudis</a> event if he wants to control this worker triangle. The Communist player has several options to prepare for Democrat control of Ruse. All of them involve control of Stara Zagorna. This will normally have player out before the end of Early Year as by then either <a href=033.html>Sajudis</a> or Ruse should have been triggered.<br>

<img src=ACCESS_BULG_INITIAL.jpg><br>
a, Stara Zagorna + Burgas:<br>
The Communist player can take control of Stara Zagorna Early Year with the help of <a href=038.html>The July Concept</a>, Nomenclatura or “spare” Ops and of Burgas with the help of <a href=038.html>The July Concept</a> or “spare” Ops. <br>
Step 1: (preparation) The Communist player takes Stara Zagora<br>
Step 2: (preparation) The Communist player takes Burgas<br> 
<img src=ACCESS_BULG_EAST_1A.jpg><br>
Step 3: The Democrat player takes Ruse<br>
Step 4: The Communist player reacts by taking control of Varna<br>
<br>
b, Stara Zagorna + Constanta:<br>
The Communist player can take control of Stara Zagorna Early Year with the help of <a href=038.html>The July Concept</a>, Nomenclatura or “spare” Ops and of Constanta with the help of <a href=010.html>Cult of Personality</a> and “spare” Ops.<br>
Step 1: (preparation) The Communist player takes Stara Zagora<br>
Step 2: (preparation) The Communist player takes Constanta<br>
<img src=ACCESS_BULG_EAST_1B.jpg><br>
Step 3: The Democrat player takes Ruse<br>
Step 4: The Communist player reacts by taking control of Varna
Once the communist player has one of the above positions he can react to the Democrat player taking control of Ruse by in turn taking control of Varna.<br>
<br>
If the Communist is late the play will look something like this.<br>
Step 1: (preparation) The Communist player takes Stara Zagora<br>
Step 2: The Democrat player takes Ruse<br>
Step 3: The Communist player reacts by taking control of Constanta<br>
Step 4: The Democrat player takes Varna and has the upper hand in the Ruse-Varna-Burgas worker triangle<br>

<br>
<b>b, Gain access to Plovdiv, Pleven and Sliven through Sofia:</b><br>
An other way for the Democrat to hold his own in Bulgaria is through gaining access to a few more spaces to draw even with the Communist player in the number of controlled spaces by breaking through or taking over Sofia. This option will often only be chosen by the Democrat player during Middle Year after the Bulgarian worker triangle is no longer an option. It is expensive, can only work against a vulnerable Communist player that doesn’t have a lot of Ops to spend to match Democrat Ops in Sofia or take Plovdiv and can expose the Democrat to a +1 Support Checks by the Communist player in Sofia and Plovdiv. Both routes into Sofia are shown below. The first route requires <a href=031.html>Intelligentsia</a> and <a href=026.html>Helsinki Final Act</a> and if the Democrat player wants to take over a not overprotected Sofia outright a 4 Ops card.<br>
<img src=ACCESS_BULG_WEST_1A.jpg><br>
The second route requires the <a href=039.html>Eco-Glasnost</a> event or a Baltic event Chain event and then a dash through the Orthodox Church space, granting the Democrat player access to the Bulgarian Intellectual/Student spaces if successful.<br>
