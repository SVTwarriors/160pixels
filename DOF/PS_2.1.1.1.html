With the +2 Die Roll Modifier it gives for the roll on both the Power Struggle's Support Loss table and Victory Points table the Rally in the Square suit is the best suit to win a Power Struggle with.
Because a Rally in the Square card always has a value of only 1, attacking with a Rally in the Square card will automatically mean losing the initiative. (Unless of course the opponent cannot match it and it thereby wins the Power Struggle.) It can therefore be tricky to win with the Rally in the Square card if, the two player's hand size is similar in size, the other drawn Power Struggle cards' suits aren't balanced or are Leaders or "useless" Wild Cards. In such a case losing the intitative can mean that the opponent counters with a suit that cannot be matched and losing the Power Struggle as a result. If the Power Struggle draw results in one player having the upper hand this player should try to win with the Rally in the Square Suit. This is certainly the case for the Democrat player towards the end of the game as he will need to take Power in as many countries as possible to reduce his Final Scoring Victory Points penalty. When the VPs are sufficiently negative going into a decisive Power Struggle brought on by the <a href=104.html>New Year's Eve Party</a> event the Democrat player might not even have a choice and will need to win with the Rally in the Square suit to have chance at winning the game. There are only 6 Rally in the Square cards in the Power Struggle deck making card counting easy. If for example a player has drawn 4 Rally in the Square cards at the start for a Power Struggle he knows for a fact that his opponent can only be holding a maximum of 2 Rally in the Square cards. The opponent can still however match the Rally in the Square suit with his "playable" Leader cards or the Tactic Fails card. The opponent could also turn the tables on the player by playing the Support Falters cards and by chance discarding up to two Rally in the Square cards. Considering all the above means winning a Power Struggle with a Rally in the Square card is far from certain in all but the most one-sided Power Struggles.<br>
