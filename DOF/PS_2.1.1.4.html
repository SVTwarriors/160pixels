There are a total of 12 Leader cards with 5 different Leader types in the Power Struggle deck.<br>
The distribution of the different Leader cards is shown below:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 4x Intellectual Leader<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 4x Elite Leader<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 2x Worker Leader<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1x Student Leader<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1x Church Leader<br>
<br>
Like a "joker" a Leader card can assume any one of the fours suits (March/Petition/Rally in the Squate/Strike) of the players choosing, but it always has a value of 3. A Leader card is only playable (offensively or defensively) by a player when he controls a space of that leader type in the country where the Power Struggle is taking place. This means a player's control of let's say an Elite space type will on average effect the Power Struggle more than a Church space because it makes four Power struggles cards playable as opposed to only one. By playing the Scare Tactics card the opponent cand during the power struggle make a type of Leader cards unplayable. For this reason mostly the more important Intellectual space and Elite Leader space in a country are often overprotected by 1 SP going into a Power Struggle. By counting the Leader cards of each type in his hand and the discard pile and combining this information with the 
space types the opponent controls in the country where the Power Struggle is taking place, a player can easily determine the maximum number of playable leader cards in the the opponent's hand. This information can then be used to decide to try to finish a player with a certain suit.
In a One-sided Power Struggle, where the opponent's remaining hand size means he is likely running out of playable Power Struggle cards, Leader cards' value of 3 means they can be played offensively as the Rally in the Square suit with only a 1/3 chance of losing inititative compared to an automatic loss of initiative. On the other hand when the player's own position is hopeless a playable leader card (that likely won't be made unplayable with the Scare Tactics cards) is often best kept to match the Rally in the Square suit only while the deciding not to match the other suits. (In a One-sided Power Struggle in a country a -2 to +1 Modifier loss can be considered a win by the weaker party.) <br>
