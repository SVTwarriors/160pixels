Recognizing the difference between a weak hand and a strong hand is very important to determine the Communist player’s strategy before his initial influence placement. This does not mean just counting Ops and cards of each faction. The Communist player also needs to assess which Democrat events need to be held and TSTed, which cards the opponent might be holding, the best time to trigger enemy events, and the damage they will cause to the Communist player’s overall position on the board. The Communist player also needs to maximize the effect of triggering his own events by considering timing, balancing their effect against the card’s Ops and their removal from the game for asterisked* events. A strong hand can allow the Communist player to play aggressively in a bid to hold on to Power in Poland and/or Hungary for consecutive Scorings and possibly Final Scoring. He should at least try to put up a good fight by outspending his opponent at the start of the game. A weak hand can allow the Communist player to decide to make a tactical retreat from an Early Year country, thereby cutting his losses there. This retreat can allow the Communist player to trigger some otherwise problematic enemy events in the surrendered Early Year country for the Ops. It can also give him more flexibility to avoid triggering crucial enemy event in the remaining Early Year country and focus his limited Ops there.<br>
<br>
Below some simple numbers are shared to help analyze Turn 1 hand strength.<br>
<br>
Breakdown of the Ops values of the Early Year cards:
<img src=OPENING_EY_CARD_BREAKDOWN.jpg></img><br>
Average Ops in Turn 1 Early Year draw: 18.2 Ops (2,275 Ops per card) <br>
<br>
Chance to draw a certain number of 4 Ops cards in an opening hand and the Opponents odds to draw zero to four 4 Ops cards (e.g. <a href=020.html>Deutsche Marks</a>, <a href=002.html>Solidarity Legalized</a>, <a href=014.html>Gorbachev Charms the West</a>, <a href=008.html>Prudence</a>):

<br>
Chance you or your opponent is holding zero to two Scoring Cards Turn 1:<br>

<br>
Even if not related to the opening the chance you or your opponent is holding zero to two Scoring Cards Turn 2 (with none drawn Turn 1):<br>
