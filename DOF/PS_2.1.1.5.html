There are a total of 4 Wild cards in the Power Struggle deck shown below:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1x Tactic Fails (Defensive Only & Lose initiative)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1x Scare Tactics (Offensive Only & Lose initiative)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1x Support Surges (Offensive Only & Lose initiative)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1x Support Falters (Offensive Only & Lose initiative)<br>
<br>
Tactic Fails:<br>
The Tactic Fails card can match any suit and make it unplayable for the rest of a Power Struggle. In a One-sided Power Struggle the Tactic Fails card is a godsent in the hand of the weaker side as it allows him to never lose on a Rally in the Square (Unless it gets discarded with the Support Falters card). On the other hand if the stronger side is holding the Tactic Fails card this side knows the opponent won't be able to use it. If by counting cards the player determines there is no (or only a minimal) risk of losing the Power Struggle by the opponent's play of the Rally in the Square suit the Tactic Fails card can be used to defend against another "vulnerable" suit.<br>
<br>
Scare Tactics:<br>
The Scare Tactics card allows it's player to, in exchange of sacrificing his initiative, remove a SP from any space in the country where the Power Struggle is taking place. This will nearly always be used early to break control of the Elite space or Intellectual space in a country to effect the playablitiy of the Leader cards the opponent could be holding and or effect the scoring by effecting the opponent's Control->Domination->Presence in the country. There are two reasons to play the Scare Tactics early. Firstly to make an opponent's Leader cards unplayable before he has had a chance to play them. Secondly in a long Power Struggle where initiative will go back and forth multiple times losing initiative early on is less important.<br>
<br>
Support Surges:<br>
The Support Surges card allows the player to draw two additional Power Struggle cards, in exchange for sacrificing his intiative. It is best played at the begining of a Power Struggle, when intiative isn't yet as valuable, the gained information can still be used to decide which tactic to use and before a suit or Leader card type has been made unplayable by the opponent. Another reeason to play it early on in a close Power Struggle, where the hand size of each player is similar, is to avoid to be forced to play it at the end of the Power Struggle. The Support Surges card is better for a player the more Leader cards are playable for him while still possibly being in the Power Struggle draw deck.
<br>
Support Falters:<br>
The Support Falters card allows the player to disard two of his opponent's Power Struggle cards, in exchange for yet again sacrificing his intiative. There are two ways to use this card. Either the Support Falters card is played early on to try to discard as many (still) playable cards. Otherwise it can be kept to discard the opponent's last two cards to win with a +0 Die Roll Modifier as opposed to the -2 Die Roll Modifier penatly of a Petition win. The card becomes more powerfull if the opponent has Raised the Stakes as he will already have discarded some of the unplayable/unuseful cards in his hand.
