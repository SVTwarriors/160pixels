Because of it's -2 Die Roll Modifier penalty on the Powers Struggle's Roll tables winning a Power Struggle with a Petition often doesn't feel like winning at. It will mostly mean the Support Loss and Victory Points damage done to the defeated player is minimal. The Petition suit is however an important way for both players to avoid the alternative which is an opponent visotry with a less disadvantageous Die Roll Modifier. Like Rally in the Square cards there are only 6 Petition cards in the Power Struggle Deck. This makes the card counting easy. Unlike the Rally in the Square cards the Petition has a high value value of 5 (3x) to 6 (3x) which will often mean that the attacker can keep the initiative and continue playing the Petition suit until the opponent runs out of cards to match a Petition suit with. Often the opponent will choose not to match a Petition suit however if he fears worse outcomes to the Power Struggle are possible from his perspective. After the Turn 7 reshuffle, as Final Scoring approaches (bar the <a href=104.html>New Year's Eve Party</a> event) and Scoring cards are triggered for the last time (bar the <a href=089.html>Domino Theory</a> event) Petition cards become dead weight in the Democrat player's hand unless the situation in the country is sor dire that taking Power is out of the question. For a Communist player in a tough spot the Petition cards remain playable and can allow him to retain power in a country that would otherwise fall. If the Democrat player chooses to do the decisive Power Struggle of the <a href=104.html>New Year's Eve Party</a> event in a country where a Democrat win could or would mean the VPs turn positive the Petition card can also save the day for the Communist player.
