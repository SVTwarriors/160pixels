With 12 cards out of a total of 52 each, March cards and Strike cards are the most common cards in the Power Struggle Deck with a value of 6 (2x), 5 (2x), 4 (4x) and 3 (4x). This means in most Power Struggles, more likely than not, the opponent will be holding both suits, will be able to match a player's attacks with these suits at least a couple of times and be able to wrestle away the initiative. While this is going on each player will try to assess their opponents strength in the different suits before finally going in for the kill. Certainly during the Power Struggles where both players have big hands and initiative will go back and forth a couple of times before the Power Struggle is resolved each player will try to read and deceive his opponent. Even though there are 12 cards of each the March and the Strike counting is still very doable and useful Power Struggles where both parties have drawn big hands. Before the Turn 7 reshuffle winning a close Power Struggle with the +0 Die Roll Modifier of the March or Strike suit is often preferable to getting greedy and running the risk of losing the Power Struggle (badly) by handing over initiative too easily. After the Turn 7 reshuffle the Democrat player should where possible try to do better than a total +0 Die Roll Modifier. This can be done with (or through the combination of) Startegy card events, Raising the stakes or deciding to try for a unlikelier Rally in the Square suit win.<br>
